- Fan of Intercal, Ant, and open source development.  
- I've sunk way too much time into contributing to and writing plugins for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky).  
- I'm also currently working on rewriting the same piece of code in as many programming languages as possible (see [Eratosthenes Benchmark](https://github.com/mOctave/eratosthenes-benchmark)).  
- I've been teaching myself Java for the last year or so, so its what I write most of my code in these days. Gradually trying to learn C++ piecemeal. Maybe Rust will be next.  
- If you talk to me about JavaScript, be prepared for a rant.
